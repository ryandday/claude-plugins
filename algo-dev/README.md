# Algo Dev Plugin

A systematic toolkit for algorithm development that helps you create specs, generate implementation plans, and execute phase-by-phase with correctness and performance verification.

## Features

### Commands

- **`/create_spec`** - Create a detailed algorithm specification with input/output examples, edge cases, and constraints
- **`/create_plan`** - Generate a structured implementation plan broken down into phases
- **`/implement_plan`** - Execute the implementation plan phase-by-phase with testing and verification

### Agents

- **`codebase-explorer`** - Explores and analyzes existing codebase patterns and structures
- **`architecture-compliance-checker`** - Verifies implementation follows architectural guidelines
- **`spec-simplifier`** - Simplifies and clarifies algorithm specifications
- **`test-quality-auditor`** - Audits test coverage and quality to ensure meaningful validation

## Usage

1. Start with `/create_spec` to define your algorithm requirements
2. Use `/create_plan` to break down the implementation into phases
3. Execute with `/implement_plan` to build and verify each phase
